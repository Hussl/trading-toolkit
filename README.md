## ðŸ‘‹ About Me
I'm a fast learner who picks up tools and frameworks quickly by building and testing real projects.  
I work well in high-speed environments by focusing on a Minimum Viable Product first, then improving features based on feedback.  

**If I had to ship quickly:**
- **Next.js** for frontend + backend in one framework
- **Supabase** for instant database and authentication
- **Vercel** for fast deployment

**AI in Production:**
Iâ€™ve integrated AI APIs (like OpenAI) into test projects for automation and chat features.  
If given the opportunity, I will make sure you never regret giving me a try.
